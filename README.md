# C# Mini-programs and Reference
A variety of mini-programs that I've made in C#, as well as a full reference project for simple operations in C#.
I'm new to C# so this does look rather basic.

## Contents
- Apollo: Reference project, which has all basic C# operations
- ApolloInteractive: Simple project requesting user input
- ApolloCalculator: Simple addition calculator that takes user input
- ApolloMadLibs: A simple, yet fun Mad Libs game
